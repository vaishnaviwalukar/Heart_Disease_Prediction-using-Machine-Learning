Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning algorithms.

Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 14 attributes including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)
Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

Install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/heart-disease-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd heart-disease-prediction

Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore data, train models, and evaluate performance:
jupyter notebook

Follow the instructions in the notebooks to preprocess data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

Models

This project implements various machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting

Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, ROC curves and confusion matrices are plotted for better understanding of model performance.

Results
The results obtained from different models are compared and discussed in the notebooks.

Contribution
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
